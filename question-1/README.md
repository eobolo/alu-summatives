With your application, the user should be able to perform the following operations
Create the student record.
Save each student record in a file under the name “students-list_0333.txt”
View all students saved in the file and list them on the terminal
Delete the student in the file (By using the student ID)
Update the student record in the list (By using the student ID)
Exit the application
